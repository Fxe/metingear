/**
 * IterativeExpansion.java â€“ 2011-07-06
 * The IterativeExpansion class fills gaps in metabolic networks but adding reactions that 'fit'
 * with a dead-end metabolite. Reactions 'fit' if they consume/produce the dead-end metabolite
 * and produce/consume another metabolite in the network. The second metabolite may also be a
 * dead-end. The method is called iterative because you could keep adding reaction to close gaps
 * until convergence is reached and there are either no more gaps or no more addable reactions.
 *
 * The object can be created in the GapFillingFactory class.
