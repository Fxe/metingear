    inferArea:
        text:    Load data from two columns, the first column is the identifier/abreviation in the model and
                 the second is the cross-reference. The resource of the cross-reference is automatically infered
                 from pattern matching. If the resource can not be matched the cross-reference is not imported.

        text:    Load data from two columns, the first column is the identifier/abreviation in the model and
